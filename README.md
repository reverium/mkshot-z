Experimental OneShot (2016) engine reimplementation for modders, derived from <code>[ModShot (mkxp-z)][mshot]</code>.

## Why?
The original engine OneShot uses (RPG Maker XP / RMXP) is nearly two decades old. It's old, slow and rather sucky.<br>
Its functionality is too restrictive for extensive modding, and its architecture is ill-suited for modern use cases.

Existing RMXP runtime reimplementations don't improve the situation. Furthermore, they're not suited for modding OneShot in particular.<br>
Using <code>[mkxp-oneshot][xpshot]</code> for your mods is greatly discouraged: it was made for the game specifically and extending upon it will be really difficult; not only that, you won't even be able to build it without manual intervention (Issue [#36](https://github.com/elizagamedev/mkxp-oneshot/issues/36)).

This project's goal is to provide a modern, feature-complete and extensible successor to <code>[mkxp-oneshot][xpshot]</code>.<br>
<code>[ModShot (mkxp-z)][mshot]</code> was the chosen one for this, but it's no longer worked on, hence why we use it as the base.

## Usage
Sorry, but this project isn't in the state where it should be used. Stay tuned...
