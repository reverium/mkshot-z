Experimental OneShot (2016) engine reimplementation for modders, derived from [ModShot (mkxp-z)][mshot].

## Why?
The engine OneShot uses (RPG Maker XP / RMXP) is nearly two decades old. It's old, slow and rather sucky.<br>
Its functionality is too restrictive for extensive modding, and the architecture is ill-suited for modern use cases.

Existing RMXP runtime reimplementations don't improve the situation. Furthermore, they're not suited for modding OneShot in particular.<br>
Using [mkxp-oneshot][xpshot] for your mods is greatly discouraged: it's designed for OneShot, not developers. You won't even be able to build it without manual intervention due to Conan remote inactivity (see elizagamedev/mkxp-oneshot#36).

This project's goal is to provide a modern, feature-complete and extensible successor to [mkxp-oneshot][xpshot].<br>
[ModShot (mkxp-z)][mshot] was the chosen one for this, but it's no longer worked on, hence why we use it as the base.

## Usage
Sorry, but this project isn't in the state where it should be used. Stay tuned...
